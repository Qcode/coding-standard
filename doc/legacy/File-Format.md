Content
=======
Each file should either be primarily PHP code, or primarily XHTML layout.
Required and included PHP files should contain only declarative code that
defines functions and/or classes. Only XHTML layout files may contain
blocks of immediately executable code.

PHP Tags
========
When opening php use the long-style tag ```<?php```. This makes it possible to
embed php inside XML. One blank line follows the ```<?php``` tag and one blank
precedes the closing ```?>``` tag.

Character Encoding
==================
Files are encoded using UTF-8.

Line Breaks
===========
Files use UNIX line breaks and end with one trailing newline character.
